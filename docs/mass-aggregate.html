The particles then interact with each other through force generators.</p><p>Please see <a class="external-link" href="physics.html">physics systems</a> for a general overview of physics systems in Trial.</p><h2 id="particles">Particles</h2><p>A <code>particle</code> is a <code>physics-entity</code> and a <code>located-entity</code>. As discussed, it has no &quot;size&quot;, so there's no associated shape or primitive at all. By default, a Verlet integration scheme is used to update the particle state, which should be stable enough for most game uses.</p><p>Particles also implement <code>resolve-hit</code> and the associated <code>resolve-velocity</code> and <code>resolve-intersection</code> functions, responsible for resolving a contact between two particles. However, since particles have no size of their own, they cannot by themselves generate contacts.</p><h2 id="contact generation">Contact Generation</h2><p>Instead, the responsibility of contact generation falls onto the <code>hit-generator</code> which must simply implement the <code>generate-hits</code> function as described for the physics systems. The following set of contact generators is provided out of the box:</p><ul><li><p><code>particle-link</code><br>A mixin class for any contact generator between two particles <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>.</p></li><li><p><code>particle-cable</code><br>A particle cable is similar to a <code>bungee-force</code> wherein the two particles are prevented from separating farther than the <code>max-length</code>, invoking the <code>restitution</code> factor if exceeded.</p></li><li><p><code>particle-rod</code><br>And the rod is similar to a <code>spring-force</code> with a specific <code>distance</code> between the particles being enforced.</p></li></ul><h2 id="mass aggregate systems">Mass Aggregate Systems</h2><p>Finally, the <code>mass-aggregate-system</code> allows you to run a simulation with particles, using <code>hit-generators</code> for contact generation. Similar to forces and particles, you can add and remove generators with <code>enter</code> and <code>leave</code>.</p><p>Otherwise the mass aggregate system implements all the necessary functionality to generate and resolve contacts, and to integrate the simulation, so no special care has to be taken.</p><p>Note that this system uses an object per particle and per contact or force generator. This does not scale well to thousands let alone millions of objects. A special matrix-based solver would have to be written to handle such scales.</p></article>
