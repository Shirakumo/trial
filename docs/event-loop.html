Basics</h2><p>An event loop must be a subclass of <code>event-loop</code>. Events can <em>technically</em> be any kind of object, but <em>should</em> be instances of <code>event</code>. In order to issue those events onto a loop, simply use <code>issue</code>. In order to process events in a loop, use <code>process</code>. You can also discard future events with <code>discard-events</code>.</p><p>The <code>main</code> class by default will use its <code>update</code> method to <code>process</code> events in the <code>scene</code>.</p><p>When events are <code>process</code>ed, <code>handle</code> is called for each event on the loop. By default this will then simply call <code>handle</code> for each listener on the loop. Listeners can be added with <code>add-listener</code> and removed with <code>remove-listener</code>. A listener should be either a function to be called with events, or an object that has a <code>handle</code> method specialised.</p><p>The marker class <code>listener</code> can be used as a mixin, causing any instances of it to be added to the event loop automatically when the instance is registered in the <code>scene</code>.</p><p><code>event</code> objects <em>must not</em> be retained outside of the call to <code>handle</code>, meaning they should effectively be considered to have dynamic-extent. This is to ensure that they can be recycled if needed, such as with event pools as shown in ยง2.</p><h2 id="2. defining events">2. Defining Events</h2><p>Events can be defined with <code>define-event</code>, which presents a <code>defstruct</code>-like interface to create new event classes. A slot without a default value will be a required argument, causing an error on initialization if not passed.</p><p>Event instances can be explicitly created using <code>make-event</code>, but usually you can instead directly use <code>issue</code>, which creates the event as needed.</p><p>It can also be desired to pool the events, in order to avoid allocation of the event instances at runtime. To do so simply use <code>define-event-pool</code> with the class name and pool size. Please be aware that the system <em>cannot</em> notice if you ever schedule more events than there are in the pool before they're processed. Doing so will lead to a prior event being overwritten and used twice. It is your responsibility to ensure the pool is appropriately sized, so use with care and only as an optimisation step.</p></article>
