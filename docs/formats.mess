# Data File Formats
Trial supports loading textures and model files from a variety of formats. However, core trial does not include support for any, instead relegating each format to its own subsystem. If you have assets that require a certain format, make sure to include the subsystem in your dependencies.

The following formats are supported:

- gif (``trial-gif``)
  Note: Only single frames are supported at the moment. You cannot play back gif animations.
- gltf (``trial-gltf``)
  Note: Only skinned mesh extraction is supported at the moment.
- jpeg (``trial-jpeg``)
- png (``trial-png``)
- ter / Terragen (``trial-terragen``)
- tga (``trial-tga``)
- tiff (``trial-tiff``)

On the sound side, please consult Harmony and cl-mixed extensions for details. The following formats are currently supported:

- mp3 (``cl-mixed-mpg123``)
  Note: MP3s fundamentally cannot loop smoothly without silence in the loop area. It is not recommended to use them for games.
- wav (``cl-mixed-wav``)
- flac (``cl-mixed-flac``)
- ogg/oga (``cl-mixed-vorbis``)
- Tracker files (``cl-mixed-mpt``)
