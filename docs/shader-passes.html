Information on shader passes as they relate to the overall pipeline and how they integrate with other entities is described in the <a class="external-link" href="render-pipeline.html">render pipeline section</a>. You should also already be familiar with the basics of the <a class="external-link" href="shaders.html">shader entity</a>, as shader passes are an extension of that mechanism.</p><p>The shader pass system lets you declare the inputs and outputs of a pass as slots on your class. Accessing those slots will give direct access to the underlying <code>texture</code> instance that is connected to the input uniform, or the output framebuffer.</p><p>This mechanism is implemented using the <a class="external-link" href="https://shinmera.com/project/flow">Flow</a> static node system. By setting the <code>:port</code> initarg on your slots, you can declare an input or output. The following port types are declared by Trial:</p><ul><li><p><code>input</code><br>A standard texture input port. This port <em>must</em> be connected to the output of one other pass' port.</p></li><li><p><code>output</code><br>A standard texture output port. This port may be connected to any number of other pass' input ports.</p></li><li><p><code>fixed-input</code><br>Unlike a standard <code>input</code>, this is meant for things like a noise texture that is manually attached to the input, without being part of the pipeline flow.</p></li><li><p><code>static-input</code><br>Unlike a standard <code>input</code> and a <code>fixed-input</code>, this port is actually allocated by the <code>pipeline</code> system. This can be useful for creating passes that have to be called iteratively, swapping the input and output between calls.</p></li></ul><p>If you need to access the actual <code>port</code> instance rather than the slot's value, you can use the <code>port</code> function, instead. This is particularly useful when actually building the shader <code>pipeline</code>, as the <code>connect</code> function takes two ports to connect together in the pipeline.</p><p>A usual pipeline building setup will thus look something like this:</p><code style="display:block" class="code-block" data-language="common lisp"><pre>(let ((render (make-instance 'render-pass))
      (shadows (make-instance 'shadow-pass))
      (mapping (make-instance 'tone-mapping-pass))
      (pipeline (make-instance 'pipeline)))
 (connect (port shadows 'shadow-map) (port render 'shadow-map) pipeline)
 (connect (port render 'color) (port mapping 'previous-pass) pipeline)
 (pack-pipeline pipeline (width *context*) (height *context*)))</pre></code><p>After the pipeline has been packed, the ports of each of the passes will contain <code>texture</code> instances that have been created according to the <code>:texspec</code> specification on the slot. A texspec is a plist that can contain most of the usual <code>texture</code> initargs, though with some special handling. The pipeline may try to merge compatible textures together to save on texture space. The following initargs are of special note:</p><ul><li><p><code>:internal-format</code><br>The internal format to use. When textures are merged together, a strict upgrade of the internal format may be allowed (more channels are provided, or higher bit depth is provided).</p></li><li><p><code>:width</code>, <code>:height</code>, <code>:depth</code><br>The size of the texture. This can be a Lisp form, where the variables <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> are bound to the current width and height of the packing target (usually the current <code>context</code>). This allows you to use things like <code>(floor width 2)</code> to use half the size of the intended width, rather than relying on static sizes.</p></li><li><p><code>:samples</code><br>Specifies the number of samples for a multisampling texture. This may be upgraded to be higher, but not lower.</p></li><li><p><code>:anisotropy</code><br>Specifies the anisotropy level for the texture. This may be upgraded to be higher, but not lower.</p></li></ul><p>You can also specify the uniform the input textures are bound to with the <code>:uniform</code> slot initarg. It defaults to the result of <code>symbol-&gt;c-name</code> of the slot name.</p><p>Please note that shader passes can be used outside of a <code>pipeline</code> instance as well, though you have to ensure that the port textures and the framebuffer are properly set yourself. Otherwise trying to load the pass will fail.</p></article></body></html><link rel="stylesheet" href="highlight-lisp.css"><script type="text/javascript" src="highlight-lisp.js"></script><script type="text/javascript">[...document.querySelectorAll('[data-language="common lisp"] pre')].map(HighlightLisp.highlight_element);</script>
