Simply adjust the system definition of your game to include the following fields:</p><code style="display:block" class="code-block" data-language="common lisp"><pre>:build-operation &quot;deploy-op&quot;
:build-pathname #+linux &quot;my-game-linux.run&quot;
                #+darwin &quot;my-game-macos.o&quot;
                #+win32 &quot;my-game-windows&quot;
                #+(and bsd (not darwin)) &quot;my-game-bsd.run&quot;
                #-(or linux bsd win32) &quot;my-game&quot;
:entry-point &quot;my-game::main&quot;
:defsystem-depends-on (:deploy)</pre></code><p>You can adapt the build pathnames as you wish, as long as the pathname types stay consistent: <code>.run</code> for Linux, <code>.o</code> for MacOS, and none for Windows (<code>.exe</code> is added by default). You can also adapt the entry point as you choose. Usually it'll be a function similar to this:</p><code style="display:block" class="code-block" data-language="common lisp"><pre>(defun main ()
  (command-line-toplevel)
  (load-keymap :package #.*package*)
  (load-settings)
  (save-settings)
  (launch 'my-game))</pre></code><p>You can now invoke <code>(asdf:make :my-game)</code> to build a release of your game. It'll be put into the <code>bin/</code> subdirectory of your system source directory. You should be able to just ZIP that directory up and give it to people to play.</p><h2 id="pruning asset files">Pruning Asset Files</h2><p>By default Trial copies all files in all asset pools it knows of. This may be over-eager, especially if you make use of asset bundles like trial-assets. To clean up some of the mess, you can use <code>define-as-unused</code>. It accepts asset names or wildcard pathnames so you can easily exclude entire directories or file types.</p><code style="display:block" class="code-block" data-language="common lisp"><pre>(define-as-unused trial
  &quot;*.glsl&quot;
  cat)</pre></code><h1 id="using the release mechanism">Using the Release Mechanism</h1><p>It is often useful to automate the build for multiple operating systems and also automate the submission. For this purpose, the <code>trial-release</code> extension exists This is a system offering automation for pushing releases of your game to a zip, Steam, Itch.io, or other services.</p><h2 id="getting set up">Getting Set Up</h2><p>First you'll want to create a new ASDF system for your game's release. The ASD file should be in a directory where your releases will be put, so ideally not in the game's source root. The ASD should be something like this:</p><code style="display:block" class="code-block" data-language="common lisp"><pre>(asdf:defsystem my-game-release
  :components ((:file &quot;release&quot;))
  :depends-on (:trial-release)
  :perform (asdf:build-op (op c) (uiop:symbol-call :org.shirakumo.fraf.trial.release :make)))</pre></code><p>The <code>release</code> file can be something like this:</p><code style="display:block" class="code-block" data-language="common lisp"><pre>(org.shirakumo.fraf.trial.release:configure
 :itch (:user &quot;my-itch-username&quot;)
 :steam (:user &quot;my-steam-username&quot;)
 :system &quot;my-game&quot;
 :depots (:content (&quot;pool/&quot;)
          :windows (&quot;*.dll&quot; &quot;*.exe&quot;)
          :linux (&quot;*.so&quot; &quot;*.run&quot;)
          :macos (&quot;*.dylib&quot; &quot;*.o&quot;))
 :bundles (:linux (:depots (:linux :content))
           :windows (:depots (:windows :content))
           :macos (:depots (:macos :content))
           :all (:depots (:linux :windows :macos :content)))
 :bundle (:targets #(:linux :windows))
 :upload (:targets #(:steam :itch)))</pre></code><p>There are other configuration parameters you can set if necessary to customise the build and release process.</p><p>Outside of this, you'll have to have the following binaries set up in your PATH:</p><ul><li><p><code>sbcl-lin</code> (linux)<br>The SBCL binary used to build the Linux version. This should be a binary that was compiled on the minimum linux kernel version you want to support. It's also recommended that you modify the <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> of it to include a directory with all necessary libraries also compiled on the same minimum kernel version.</p></li><li><p><code>sbcl-win</code> (linux)<br>The SBCL Windows binary used to build the Windows version. This can be a wrapper using Wine, which works really well to build for Windows under Linux.</p></li><li><p><code>sbcl-mac</code> (linux)<br>The SBCL binary used to build the Mac version. This is currently unsupported, but in the future once Darling works better this could be used to deploy to that platform from Linux as well.</p></li><li><p><code>pass</code> (optional)<br>Used to retrieve passwords and other secrets for uploads. If not present, will query for a password at the REPL.</p></li></ul><p>Once all of this is ready, you can run a build using <code>(asdf:make :my-game-release)</code> or manually invoking <code>org.shirakumo.fraf.trial.release:make</code> after loading that system.<br>For the <code>sbcl-*</code> variants, you can use the binaries and scripts from the following repository: <a href="https://gitea.tymoon.eu/shinmera/trial-deployment">https://gitea.tymoon.eu/shinmera/trial-deployment</a> They have been pre-tested.</p><h2 id="build configuration">Build Configuration</h2><p>You can configure the build with the following options, all under the <code>:build</code> scope:</p><ul><li><p><code>:features</code> A list of symbols to push onto *features* when building.</p></li><li><p><code>:build-arguments</code> A list of command line argmuents to pass on when building.</p></li><li><p><code>:dynamic-space-size</code> The max heap size to use when building.</p></li><li><p><code>:linux</code> The binary used to build for Linux from linux.</p></li><li><p><code>:windows</code> The binary used to build for Windows from linux.</p></li><li><p><code>:macos</code> The binary used to build for MacOS form linux.</p></li><li><p><code>:targets</code> Which targets to build by default (can include :linux, :windows, :macos).</p></li><li><p><code>:prune</code> Specify directories or files that should be removed before deploying. Paths are relative to the target directory.</p></li><li><p><code>:copy</code> Specify additional files that should be copied before deploying. May be a path or a list of source and target. Source paths are relative to the system root, target paths relative to the output directory.</p></li></ul><h2 id="bundle configuration">Bundle Configuration</h2><p>Some upload mechanisms require appropriate bundles to be configured. Bundles will also produce standalone ZIP files that you can distribute manually. To configure bundles, you must first configure depots. A depot is a list of paths in the release that belong to it. Each path in a depot may be either:</p><ul><li><p>A plain path, in which case the singular file is copied.</p></li><li><p>A directory path, in which case the directory is copied recursively.</p></li><li><p>A wild path, in which case all matching files are copied.</p></li></ul><p>Once your depots are configured, you can specify the bundles. Each bundle under the <code>:bundles</code> scope should be a plist of the following options:</p><ul><li><p><code>:depots</code> The list of depots to include in the bundle.</p></li><li><p><code>:file-format</code> An optional format string by which to create the file name for the bundle. Is passed the three arguments:</p><ul><li><p>The <code>:system</code> key.</p></li><li><p>The bundle's name.</p></li><li><p>The current version string.</p></li></ul><p>By default the format string is just <code>~(~a-~a-~a~)</code>.</p></li></ul><p>To configure which bundles are actually created when you run a default release build, fill the vector for <code>:bundle :targets</code>.</p><h2 id="upload configurations">Upload Configurations</h2><p>The Trial release mechanism supports a number of upload mechanisms to automatically distribute releases to different platforms. See the sections below on how to configure them. If you would like to automatically push releases, make sure to add the upload mechanism to the <code>:upload :targets</code> array.</p><h3 id="steam">Steam</h3><p>Steam will require some VDF files to configure your build in addition. Please consult the SteamWorks documentation on how to do that. However, be aware that the base file should be called <code>app-build.vdf</code> and should be in the same directory as your <code>my-game-release.asd</code> file, and should have several fields set specially so the Trial release mechanism can operate properly. Here's an example:</p><code style="display:block" class="code-block"><pre>&quot;appbuild&quot;{
  &quot;appid&quot; &quot;1261430&quot;
  &quot;desc&quot; &quot;Kandria developer build&quot;
  &quot;buildoutput&quot; &quot;../steam/&quot;
  &quot;contentroot&quot; &quot;$CONTENT&quot;
  &quot;setlive&quot; &quot;$BRANCH&quot;
  &quot;preview&quot; &quot;$PREVIEW&quot;
  &quot;local&quot; &quot;&quot;
  &quot;depots&quot;{
    &quot;1261431&quot; &quot;../windows-depot.vdf&quot;
    &quot;1261432&quot; &quot;../linux-depot.vdf&quot;
    &quot;1261433&quot; &quot;../macos-depot.vdf&quot;
    &quot;1261434&quot; &quot;../content-depot.vdf&quot;
  }
}</pre></code><p>The Trial release build will automatically take this file and replace the <code>$</code> variables, then copy it to a subdirectory where the upload happens, hence the <code>../</code> backrefs in the paths. The depot VDF files do not need any special configuration.</p><p>The <code>steamcmd</code> also needs to be available in your PATH.</p><p>In the configuration, the following keys are available in the <code>:steam</code> scope:</p><ul><li><p><code>:branch</code> The branch to which to push on Steam</p></li><li><p><code>:preview</code> Whether it should only preview the upload and not actually perform it</p></li><li><p><code>:user</code> The user with which you log in to perform the upload</p></li><li><p><code>:password</code> The password for the user. If NIL will try to get it from pass or query for it.</p></li></ul><h3 id="itch">Itch</h3><p>To upload to itch, you will need to have the <code>butler</code> program in your PATH. Make sure to run Butler once before to save the login credentials.</p><p>In the configuration, the following keys are available in the <code>:itch</code> scope:</p><ul><li><p><code>:user</code> The user under which the project is located.</p></li><li><p><code>:password</code> If given, should be the cached token that Butler stores in a file when you log in. This lets you automate login without your user password.</p></li><li><p><code>:project</code> The name of the project. Defaults to the <code>:system</code> key.</p></li></ul><h3 id="gog">GOG</h3><p>To upload to GOG, you need the <code>GOGGalaxyPipelineBuilder</code> program in your PATH. You can run it first to cache credentials, or pass them in the Trial configuration.</p><p>In the configuration, the following keys are available in the <code>:gog</code> scope:</p><ul><li><p><code>:user</code> The username to log in with</p></li><li><p><code>:password</code> The password to log in with</p></li><li><p><code>:branch</code> The branch to push the build to. If the branch is password protected, this should be a list of the branch name and its password.</p></li></ul><h3 id="keygen">Keygen</h3><p>To upload to a <a class="external-link" href="https://shirakumo.org/projects/keygen">Keygen</a> instance, you'll need to generate an oAuth application on your instance and also authorise a token using the standard oAuth flow. If you use pass, you should create a pass entry with your tokens and secrets in it. On the Keygen side, create a project and a file under the project for each of the bundles you want to upload. On the release side you'll of course need the corresponding bundles to upload.</p><p>In the configuration, the following keys are available in the <code>:keygen</code> scope:</p><ul><li><p><code>:bundles</code> A plist of bundles to upload, with the corresponding IDs of the files to upload to.</p></li><li><p><code>:key</code> The oAuth application key.</p></li><li><p><code>:secret</code> The oAuth application secret.</p></li><li><p><code>:token</code> The oAuth token for your authorisation.</p></li><li><p><code>:token-secret</code> The oAuth token secret key.</p></li><li><p><code>:api-base</code> The base URL under which to perform keygen API calls. Something like: <a href="https://keygen.tymoon.eu/api/">https://keygen.tymoon.eu/api/</a></p></li><li><p><code>:secrets</code> The password to query for the tokens/secrets. If unspecified defaults to the api-base.</p></li></ul><h3 id="http">HTTP</h3><p>This will perform a simple HTTP request to upload bundle payloads.</p><p>In the configuration, the following keys are available in the <code>:http</code> scope:</p><ul><li><p><code>:bundles</code> A list of bundles to upload.</p></li><li><p><code>:url</code> The URL to send the request to.</p></li><li><p><code>:method</code> The method by which to send the request. Defaults to POST.</p></li><li><p><code>:file-parameter</code> Which parameter the payload is sent under.</p></li><li><p><code>:parameters</code> Additional content parameters to send.</p></li></ul><h3 id="rsync">Rsync</h3><p>This will use the <code>rsync</code> tool to send the file to a remote server. <code>rsync</code> must be in the PATH and available on the remote server as well.</p><p>In the configuration, the following keys are available in the <code>:rsync</code> scope:</p><ul><li><p><code>:bundles</code> A list of bundles to upload.</p></li><li><p><code>:user</code> The user by which to connect.</p></li><li><p><code>:port</code> The port under which to connect.</p></li><li><p><code>:hostname</code> The hostname of the server to connect to.</p></li><li><p><code>:path</code> The path under which to upload the bundle.</p></li></ul><h3 id="ssh">SSH</h3><p>This will use an SSH connection to send the file to a remote server.</p><p>In the configuration, the following keys are available in the <code>:ssh</code> scope:</p><ul><li><p><code>:bundles</code> A list of bundles to upload.</p></li><li><p><code>:user</code> The user by which to connect.</p></li><li><p><code>:port</code> The port under which to connect.</p></li><li><p><code>:password</code> The password for the user.
