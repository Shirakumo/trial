  ()
  (:default-initargs :steam '(:app-id 170)))</pre></code><p>Note that even if you do this, the game will continue to work even if launched outside of Steam or if Steam isn't even present at all. It will try to connect to Steam on startup, but will just disable the extra integration bits if unavailable.</p><p>This integration will also automatically integrate with Trial's <a class="external-link" href="achievements.html">achievements</a> system.</p><h2 id="gamepad text input">Gamepad Text Input</h2><p>For full gamepad compatibility compliance any text input must be doable with a gamepad. Under Steam you can get an on-screen keyboard by using the appropriate Steamworks calls. The integration system will take care of translating the resulting text into a <code>text-entered</code> event. For Alloy, the following integration should be suitable:</p><code style="display:block" class="code-block" data-language="common lisp"><pre>(defmethod alloy:activate :after ((input alloy:text-input-component))
  (when (and (steam:steamworks-available-p)
             (not (eql :keyboard +input-source+)))
    (or (steam:show-text-input (steam:interface 'steam:steamutils T)
                               :default (alloy:text input))
        (steam:show-floating-text-input (steam:interface 'steam:steamutils T))
        (v:warn :trial.steam &quot;Failed to open gamepad text input panel...&quot;))))</pre></code><p>Note that, as of this writing, opening the text input panel will fail unless the game is started through Big Picture Mode or is on the Steam Deck. This is expected.</p><!-- TODO: Fixup SteamInput and make the translation stuff work--></article></body></html><link rel="stylesheet" href="highlight-lisp.css"><script type="text/javascript" src="highlight-lisp.js"></script><script type="text/javascript">[...document.querySelectorAll('[data-language="common lisp"] pre')].map(HighlightLisp.highlight_element);</script>
