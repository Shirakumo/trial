#| Keymap should have the following syntax:

keymap    ::= mapping*
mapping   ::= (type action trigger*)
type      ::= retain | trigger
trigger   ::= (key one-of edge?)
            | (mouse one-of edge?)
            | (button one-of edge?)
            | (axis one-of edge? threshold?)
one-of    ::= :one-of label
edge      ::= :edge :rise | :edge :fall
threshold ::= :threshold number
action    --- a symbol naming an action event
label     --- a keyword naming a key or button label

Examples:

(trigger quicksave
(label :english "Quick Save")
(key :one-of (:f5)))

(retain dash
(label :english "Dash")
(axis :one-of (:r2) :threshold 0.2))
